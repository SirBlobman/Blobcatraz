1) Respect everyone
2) Do not cheat. 
	- 'Hacked' clients and mods count as cheating. 
	- OptiFine and Shaders are perfectly fine
	- XRay texture packs are also cheating
3) Slimes are the best
	- Ignoring this rule will get you permanently banned
4) Do not impersonate staff members, or colored chat will be disabled
5) Do not use exploits or glitches in your favor
	- If you show an staff member they will fix it and reward you
6) Do not spam in chat
	- First time its a warning and 15 second mute
	- Second time is a kick
	- Third time is perma ban
	- Advertising gets no warnings, just perma ban

1) You must help the server
	- Joining and just being AFK does not count
	- Not joining for a week means you will be demoted
	- There are exceptions, such as family and vacations
2) Do not abuse your powers
	- Lying about it will get you banned
3) Do not summon things that will create lag
4) Spawn items for people is unfair, even dirt (this is SkyBlock)
